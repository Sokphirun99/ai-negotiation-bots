# 🤝 AI Negotiation Bots

This project explores multi-agent negotiation using autonomous agents with varying strategies — including RL-trained negotiators, cooperative bots, and adversarial agents. Simulations evaluate the ability to reach optimal agreements under dynamic utility conditions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build negotiation agents with diverse behaviors
- Train RL agents to maximize reward under uncertainty
- Simulate negotiations with multiple utility models
- Analyze results to find equilibrium and social welfare impacts

## 🧠 Agent Types
| Agent Type         | Strategy                      |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| RuleBasedAgent     | Fixed offer thresholds        |
| RLNegotiatorAgent  | PPO agent with utility maximization |
| CooperativeAgent   | Fair deal seeker              |
| AdversarialAgent   | Maximize gain, risk failure   |

## 🚀 Run Simulation

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Simulate a negotiation round
python simulations/agent_vs_agent.py --agent1 rl --agent2 adversarial
```

---

📊 Outputs
	•	CSV logs of each negotiation round
	•	Plots showing success rate vs. agent type
	•	Nash equilibrium visualizations

## 🧠 Sample Agent Code

```python
class RuleBasedAgent:
    def __init__(self, min_accept=0.6):
        self.min_accept = min_accept
    
    def propose(self, last_offer):
        return 1.0 - (1.0 - self.min_accept) * 0.9
    
    def respond(self, offer):
        return offer >= self.min_accept

# 📈 Sample Plot (Success Rate by Agent Pairing)

Use strategy_analysis.ipynb to generate:
	•	Bar charts of successful deal percentages
	•	Line plots of average agreement utility
	•	Heatmaps of negotiation durations

---

# 🔐 Bonus Ideas
	•	Add time-based pressure (deadlines + decaying utility)
	•	Implement deception (false signaling of preferences)
	•	Use a Streamlit dashboard to let users simulate negotiation bots in-browser
